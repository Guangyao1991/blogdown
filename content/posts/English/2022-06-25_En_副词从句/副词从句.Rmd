## 副词从句和形容词从句的比较

- **Because** he needs the money, he works hard：because 为从属连接；he needs the money 为副词从句；works hard 为主要从句。
- He needs the money, and he works hard：He needs the money 为对等从句；and 为连接词；works hard 为对等从句。

## 副词从句和名词从句的比较

- The witness said that **he saw the whole thing**：he saw the whole thing 为名词从句。
- The witness said this, **though he didn’t really see it**：though 为连接词；he didn’t really see it 为副词从句。

两者差别：

- 名词从句连接词无意义；副词连接词有意义。
- 名词从句放入从句中的名词位置，即原句中有不完整的成分；副词从句是修饰语的词类，要附在完整的主要从句上做修饰语。


## 副词从句的种类
